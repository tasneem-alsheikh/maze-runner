# Assignment 2: Maze Runner 🌟
*By Tasneem Al Sheikh*

Below are my solutions for Assignment 2. I've worked hard to make everything clear and efficient, and I hope you enjoy reading through my progress! 😊<br><br>
*Note: I made a subdirectory of the repository, and any code modified was put in this readme.md along with the results.*

## Question 1: How the Automated Maze Explorer Works ✨
Here's how the original maze explorer operates

### The Algorithm Used
- The explorer uses the right-hand rule algorithm. It starts facing right and tries moves in this order: turn right and move, go straight, turn left, or turn around.
- It keeps going until it reaches the end. When I ran it with visualization, I noticed it sticks to walls, always favoring right turns first.

### Handling Loops
- It tracks the last three moves in move_history to spot loops. If it's stuck (same spot three times), is_stuck() it backtracks.
- This keeps it from spinning forever in tricky mazes.

### Backtracking Strategy
- When stuck, it uses backtrack() to retreat to a spot with more options (via find_backtrack_path). The backtrack_count counts these moments.
- In my tests, it was often 0—simple mazes didn't need much backtracking, which was nice!

### Statistics Provided
At the end, it shares:
- Time taken: Like 46.29s with visuals, 0.00s without.
- Moves made: E.g., 233 for random mazes, 1279 for static ones.
- Backtrack operations: Usually 0 in my runs.
- Moves per second: 5.03 with visuals, over 1M without.

### Observations
- With visualization (JupyterExplorer), it's slow but shows every step—so helpful for understanding! Without, it's lightning-fast ⚡.
- Random mazes took fewer moves; static ones had longer paths. In explorer.py, solve() loops through directions and backtracks if needed, matching what I saw perfectly.

## Question 2: Running Multiple Maze Explorers with MPI4Py 🚀
### What I Did
I adjusted main.py to use MPI4Py, letting multiple explorers solve the maze together. I turned off visualization to speed things up. Since each explorer solves the same randomly generated maze independently, the paths they take may differ slightly. I gathered their stats—time and number of moves—to see who completed it most efficiently.


### How It Works
- **Parallel Explorers**: MPI4Py splits the work across processes—each rank runs one explorer on the same maze.
- **Stats Collection**: They send time and moves to rank 0 using gather.
- **Comparison**: Rank 0 lists results and picks the winner with the fewest moves.

### Code
Here's my main.py:

```python
import argparse
from mpi4py import MPI
from src.maze import create_maze
from src.explorer import Explorer

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Maze Runner with MPI4Py")
    parser.add_argument("--type", choices=["random", "static"], default="random")
    parser.add_argument("--width", type=int, default=30)
    parser.add_argument("--height", type=int, default=30)
    args = parser.parse_args()

    comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
    rank = comm.Get_rank()

    maze = create_maze(args.width, args.height, args.type)
    
    explorer = Explorer(maze, visualize=False)
    time_taken, moves = explorer.solve()

    results = comm.gather((rank, time_taken, len(moves)), root=0)

    if rank == 0:
        print("\n=== Results ===")
        best_rank, best_time, best_moves = results[0]
        for r, t, m in results:
            print(f"Explorer {r}: {t:.2f}s, {m} moves")
            if m < best_moves:
                best_rank, best_time, best_moves = r, t, m
        print(f"\nBest: Explorer {best_rank} with {best_moves} moves in {best_time:.2f}s")
        print("==============")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### What I Saw
I ran it with 4 explorers, and here's my output:
```
=== Results ===
Explorer 0: 0.00s, 94 moves
Explorer 1: 0.00s, 241 moves
Explorer 2: 0.00s, 163 moves
Explorer 3: 0.00s, 550 moves

Best: Explorer 0 with 94 moves in 0.00s
==============
```

Explorer 0 won with just 94 moves! Times were all 0.00s since it's so fast without visuals.

### Notes
- I used visualize=False for speed—drawing slows things down!
- MPI4Py made parallel runs a breeze 🌬️, and the random maze gave different paths, with Explorer 0 shining brightest.

## Question 3: Analyzing Maze Explorers on Static Maze 🌍
### What I Did
I ran 4 explorers on a 30x30 static maze using MPI4Py, collecting their time, moves, and backtracks to see how they compare.

### Code
Here's my main.py:

```python
from mpi4py import MPI
from src.maze import create_maze
from src.explorer import Explorer

def main():
    comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
    rank = comm.Get_rank()

    maze = create_maze(30, 30, "static")
    explorer = Explorer(maze, visualize=False)
    time_taken, moves = explorer.solve()
    backtrack_count = explorer.backtrack_count

    results = comm.gather((rank, time_taken, len(moves), backtrack_count), root=0)

    if rank == 0:
        print("\n=== Static Maze Explorer Results ===")
        for r, t, m, b in results:
            print(f"Explorer {r}: Time = {t:.2f}s, Moves = {m}, Backtracks = {b}")
        print("====================================")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Results
Ran mpiexec -n 4 python main.py:
```

==================================

=== Static Maze Explorer Results ===
Explorer 0: Time = 0.00s, Moves = 1279, Backtracks = 0

Explorer 2: Time = 0.00s, Moves = 1279, Backtracks = 0
Explorer 3: Time = 0.00s, Moves = 1279, Backtracks = 0
====================================
```

### Observations
- **Moves**: All took 1279 moves—makes sense since the static maze is the same every time, and they all follow the right-hand rule down the same path.
- **Time**: All 0.00s—so quick without visuals. Tiny differences in moves/sec (e.g., 567133.40 vs. 645782.45).
- **Backtracks**: All 0—the static maze has no loops or dead ends to trip them up.
- **What I Noticed**: Since the static maze is identical for all processes and the algorithm is deterministic (right-hand rule), all explorers took the exact same number of steps. MPI here confirms that the explorer logic is consistent across parallel processes, even when running independently. The slight moves/sec variation is just MPI juggling things, but the path stays steady.

## Question 4: Enhancing the Maze Explorer 🌈
### What I Did
Using Question 3's results (1279 moves, 0 backtracks), I upgraded the explorer with A* and a visited set to make it smarter. To improve the explorer’s efficiency, I implemented the A* algorithm with Manhattan distance as the heuristic. This allows the explorer to prioritize shorter paths toward the goal rather than blindly following walls. While I didn’t benchmark it against the original in full detail, early tests showed that A* significantly reduced the number of moves compared to the right-hand rule on larger mazes.


In summary, the A*-based explorer is more strategic, avoids unnecessary loops, and makes faster progress toward the goal. It's a great improvement over the original method, especially in complex maze scenarios.


### Limitations of the Current Explorer
**Right-Hand Rule is Too Basic**:
- Took 1279 moves which is a lot. It follows walls blindly instead of finding shortcuts.
- Problem: Not efficient enough.

**Loop Detection is Weak**:
- Only checks 3 moves. Bigger loops would trap it, though we got lucky with 0 backtracks.
- Problem: Struggles with complex mazes.

**Backtracking is Inefficient**:
- Doesn't recall past tries, risking repeats (not an issue in Question 3).
- Problem: Slows down in tough mazes.

### Proposed Improvements
- **A* Algorithm**: Used A* with Manhattan distance for the shortest path becasue it's goal-smart.
- **Track All Visited Spots**: Log every position to catch all loops. Because it saves moves.
- **Dead-End Memory**: Skip known dead ends. Why? Speeds things up (I didn't implement it here).

### Explanation of Changes
**A* Algorithm**:
- What I Changed: Swapped right-hand rule for A* with a priority queue and heuristic().
- Why It's Better: Moves fell from 1279 to 128. It's like giving the explorer a map! 🗺️

**Visited Tracking**:
- What I Changed: Added a visited set to skip repeats, counting skips as backtracks.
- Why It's Better: Stops all loops, with 1023 backtracks showing it's thorough—keeps moves low!

### Why It's Smarter
A* was used in the assignment to optimize the explorer’s pathfinding, reducing the 1279 moves by prioritizing paths with a heuristic that estimates the distance to the goal. The visited set prevented redundant exploration, maintaining efficiency with 0 backtracks. This made the explorer smarter by finding shorter paths in a complex environment.

## Question 5: Comparing Original and Enhanced Explorers ⚖️
### What I Did
I compared the original (right-hand rule) and enhanced (A*) explorers on the static maze with MPI4Py—2 of each.

### Code
My main.py:
```python
from mpi4py import MPI
from src.maze import create_maze
from src.explorer_original import Explorer as ExplorerOriginal
from src.explorer_enhanced import Explorer as ExplorerEnhanced

def main():
    comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
    rank = comm.Get_rank()
    size = comm.Get_size()

    if size < 2:
        print("Need at least 2 processes!")
        return

    maze = create_maze(30, 30, "static")

    if rank < size // 2:
        explorer = ExplorerOriginal(maze, visualize=False)
        version = "Original"
    else:
        explorer = ExplorerEnhanced(maze, visualize=False)
        version = "Enhanced"

    time_taken, moves = explorer.solve()
    backtrack_count = explorer.backtrack_count

    results = comm.gather((version, rank, time_taken, len(moves), backtrack_count), root=0)

    if rank == 0:
        print("\n=== Explorer Comparison Results ===")
        for v, r, t, m, b in results:
            print(f"{v} Explorer {r}: Time = {t:.2f}s, Moves = {m}, Backtracks = {b}")
        print("====================================")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Results

Enhanced Explorer 3: Time = 0.00s, Moves = 128, Backtracks = 1023
====================================
```

### Performance Comparison
**Moves**:
- Original: 1279 — Very long.
- Enhanced: 128 — 90% less and smart. 🚀

**Time**:
- Both: 0.00s — Too fast to tell apart without visuals.

**Backtracks**:
- Original: 0 — Simple maze, no need.
- Enhanced: 1023 — A* explores tons to optimize!

### Visualizations
With visualize=True:
- Original: Zigzags everywhere, cute but slow!
- Enhanced: Nearly straight, elegant and quick! ✨

Chart Idea: Original (1279) vs. Enhanced (128), as we can see this is a huge jump!

### Trade-Offs
**Wins**:
- Enhanced is move-efficient (128 vs. 1279) which makes it perfect for real mazes!
- Stops loops.

**Trade-Offs**:
- Uses more memory (visited set, queue) fine for 30x30, maybe not 1000x1000.
- More computation per step but still fast.

**New Limits**:
- High backtracks (1023) might confuse counts skips, not just reverses.
- Trickier to tweak than the original's simplicity.

## Question 6: Solving the Static Maze in Few Moves 🏆
### What I Did
Used my enhanced explorer to hit 150 (10 pts), 135 (15 pts), or 130 moves (20 pts/100%) in asolo run!

### Code
My main.py:
```python
from src.maze import create_maze
from src.explorer_enhanced import Explorer

def main():
    maze = create_maze(30, 30, "static")
    explorer = Explorer(maze, visualize=False)
    time_taken, moves = explorer.solve()
    backtrack_count = explorer.backtrack_count
    
    print("\n=== Static Maze Solo Run ===")
    print(f"Time = {time_taken:.2f}s, Moves = {len(moves)}, Backtracks = {backtrack_count}")
    print("=============================")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Results
Ran python main.py:
```

### How I Did It
- A*: Finds the shortest path—128 moves vs. 1279!
- Visited Tracking: Keeps it loop-free—smart memory!



Note: This is one of the most fun assignments I've worked on :)
